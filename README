VoteFair-Negotiation-Tool

This software negotiation tool can be used to negotiate fair outcomes for real-life situations such as:

    * insurance settlements
    * buyer-seller bargaining
    * terms of employment
    * contractor-homeowner disputes
    * consultant-client contracts
    * investment contracts
    * divorce settlements
    * marriage counseling agreements
    * inheritance distributions
    * landlord-tenant contracts

Notice that it handles both friendly and hostile situations.

It's designed to handle dozens of participants, yet it also can accomodate just two people.

Using this negotiation tool primarily consists of adding proposals and ranking those proposals.  Whenever you request seeing the latest suggested resolution, the latest results are immediately calculated.

The calculation method is based on VoteFair ranking, which is a voting method explained at VoteFair.org and in the book Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections.

A free demo of this code is running at:

If your “negotiation” just involves choosing one or two “winning” choices based on their popularity, please use the also-free VoteFair Ranking tool at:

    VoteFair.org

For security reasons Access IDs and related code have been removed from this open-source version.

Version 1.00

Please regard this as a beta version for experimentation purposes, and not yet ready to handle very important negotiations.


RUNNING

This code does NOT run as-is because:

    * The Access ID code has been removed.

This code should be revised in the following ways:

    * The core calculation code, which is in the file sub_sort_proposals_overall.pl, should be integrated into the VoteFair ranking code, preferably the C++ version.

    * The remaining Perl code (which handles viewing proposals, ranking proposals, identifying incompatible pairs of proposals, logging in, etc.) should be replaced by equivalent Dashrep code.

    * All the Dashrep code should be updated to the current version of the Dashrep language.

This code does include the old Dashrep interpreter that handles the older Dashrep code here.


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is included within the code.

Information about the Dashrep language is at: www.Dashrep.org
