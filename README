VoteFair-Negotiation-Tool

This software negotiation tool can be used to negotiate fair outcomes for real-life situations such as:

    * insurance settlements
    * buyer-seller bargaining
    * terms of employment
    * contractor-homeowner disputes
    * consultant-client contracts
    * investment contracts
    * divorce settlements
    * marriage counseling agreements
    * inheritance distributions
    * landlord-tenant contracts

Here are some important characteristics:

* It handles both friendly and hostile situations.

* It can handle dozens of participants, it can handle just two people, or it could be used among all members of Congress.

* It can handle hundreds of proposals.

* Each participant submits proposals.  Each proposal is short, just a single sentence or single paragraph.

* When new proposals are added, each participant indicates which proposals they like, and which proposals they dislike.  All other proposals are ranked as neutral.

* Each time the negotiation tool software runs, it identifies the optimum combination of proposals that are most strongly appreciated by the most participants.

* If the suggested combination of proposals includes proposals that are incompatible with each other, an administrator updates the information about which proposals are incompatible with specifid other proposals.  Then running the software again eliminates the incompatible proposals.

* All the participants rank all the proposals, although lots of proposals can be ranked at level zero (0), which indicates the neutral level (neither liked nor disliked).  Liked proposals are ranked with positive integers up to 100.  Disliked proposals are ranked with negative integers down to minus 100 (-100).  Gaps between the numbers are not significant.  Only the relative ranking (compared to other rankings from the same participant) is significant.
